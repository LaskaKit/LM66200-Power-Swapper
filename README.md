# LaskaKit LM66200 Power Swapper

Two possible voltage sources (maybe two batteries) that you can connect to your device? How to connect it? Maybe through a diode to your device, but there will be a voltage drop across the diode and also cause a power loss. 

That's why we designed the LM66200 Power Swapper - a module with an integrated LM66200 circuit. This integrated circuit contains a circuit called the ideal diode. The resistance of this diode is 40 mR, the maximum current flowing is 2.5A and the operating voltage is from 1.6V to 5.5V.

With this module, you simply connect two voltage sources to your device and you don't have to worry about any buffer currents between the input sources or voltage drop across the diodes.
